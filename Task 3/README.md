# Week 3 – Data Analysis with Pandas
This project is the Week 3 deliverable for the internship assignment.
The task was to analyze a small, publicly available dataset using Python’s Pandas (and optionally NumPy).

# Dataset
The dataset used is the Iris dataset (iris.csv), which contains measurements of iris flowers:

sepal length (cm)
sepal width (cm)
petal length (cm)
petal width (cm)
species (flower type)

# Tasks Completed
1. Explore the Data

Displayed the first few rows using data.head()
Checked data types of each column with data.info()
Generated summary statistics with data.describe()

2. Calculate Basic Statistics

Mean, median, and standard deviation for all numerical features
Mode of each feature
Correlation matrix between numerical features
